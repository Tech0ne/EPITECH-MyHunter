## What is it ?

MyHunter is a project that aim to recreate the well known Duck Hunt game, using C and CSFML lib.

As we are free to use any kind of assets, I changed the aspect of the game as well as it's atmosphere.

## How to play ?

First, install gcc, make and the CSFML lib.

On Ubuntu, you can use the following command :

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gcc make libcsfml-dev

Once you have them, clone this repository, and run `make` to compile the project.

You can then run the executable with :

    ./my_hunter

Enjoy !!
